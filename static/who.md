                    <p>Automate your entire application environment by treating your infrastructure as code. Through configuration management tools such as Chef and 
                        Windows PowerShell® Desired State Configuration (DSC), we automate the deployment and scaling of your application environments.</p>

                    <p>(LM) comprises an approach to dealing with large volumes of computer-generated log messages (also known as audit records, audit trails, event-logs, etc.). LM covers: log collection. centralized aggregation. long-term retention.</p>

                    <p>The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. While somewhat more complicated than the Feature Branch Workflow, this provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.</p>

                    <p>We expected that automation would make deployments faster, and of course it did – computers are good at making things faster. Automation can lead to shorter iteration and feedback cycles, by reducing the risk and effort involved in deploying software to production.</p>
