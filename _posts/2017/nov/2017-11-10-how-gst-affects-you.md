  India has been set on GST mode, which enables the taxpayers to pay a single tax instead of multiple indirect taxes.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides re-sizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.
For startups and small businesses, GST billing has emerged as a ray of respite from the taxes. In the earlier system, a business having more than RS 5 lakh as annual turnover was required to pay Value Added Tax (VAT). However, under GST, this threshold amount has been replaced by 20 lakhs, which exempts many small businesses as well as startups. Even for turnovers between 20 to 50 lakhs, the businesses can opt for a composition scheme, which requires them to pay nominal tax. 

We are working from last 10 years in IT I remember time where if we needed a new Active Directory Server or a new SQL Server we have to go to HP or go to DELL order new servers we then had to get deliver to our data centers we had to get racked we had to do the networking setup them the internet accessible etc and you know your provisioning time should be anywhere from 5 to 10 business days. Then i started public cloud and was really exciting to see the capabilities of cloud in step having of 5 to 10 days lead time you would reduce to literally just couple of minutes you can have that server up and running so thatâ€™s really how cloud computing change the IT industry in the last 5 to 10 years so Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios. So we just look at the first section the advantage of the cloud computing is utility based model you can pay only by the hour. If you want to spin up the development environment and just test on it and then terminate you only pay for 1 or 2 hours the environment is live the old model way you would buy the server hardware you would be stuck with it.

###### Elastic Compute Cloud Pricing Options
* ###### Free Tier-  
 you get 735 hours free on certain micro instances.
 * ###### On Demand- 
 Which allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment.
  * ###### Reserved- 
  Which provide you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. Then you have 1 Year or 3 Year Terms so reserved just saying i need 10 servers of this size and i am willing to pay either up-front contractual willing to commit for 1 to 3 years and if you do use reserved instances then you get massive discounts compared with on demand.
  * ###### Spot- 
  This is enable you to bid whatever price you want to pay for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
  ###### Elastic Compute Cloud On Demand vs Reserved vs Spot
  * ###### On Demand Instances
    * Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
